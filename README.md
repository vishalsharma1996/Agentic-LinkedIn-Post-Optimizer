# Agentic LinkedIn Post Optimizer (LangGraph + FastAPI)

![Architecture](docs/Architecture_Image2.png)

This project demonstrates how to turn manual prompt iteration into a deterministic, agentic workflow using LangGraph and FastAPI.

Instead of repeatedly prompting an LLM to rewrite content, the system models writing as a controlled loop with explicit agent roles, clear stopping conditions, and inspectable state.

The focus is systems and control flow, not prompt hacking.

# Agentic LinkedIn Post Optimizer

This repository demonstrates how to replace prompt–rewrite loops with a deterministic, inspectable agentic system for generating and refining LinkedIn posts.

The goal is not better prompts — it is better control loops.

---

## Why This Project Exists

Most AI writing workflows look like this:

Prompt → Rewrite → Rewrite → Rewrite → Accept something mediocre

This project replaces that pattern by moving iteration control into code, not prompts. Writing, evaluation, optimization, stopping, rollback, and summarization are handled by explicit agent roles governed by deterministic rules.

The result is repeatable behavior, predictable convergence, and clear failure modes.

---

## What This System Does

At a high level, the system:

1. Classifies intent (Proof of Work vs Tech Thought Leadership)
2. Grounds generation using intent-aware reference patterns
3. Generates an initial draft using strict intent rules
4. Evaluates the draft using structured, deterministic scoring
5. Optimizes only the weakest dimensions under hard constraints
6. Stops or rolls back based on code-enforced logic
7. Always returns the best iteration, never the last explored one

Acceptance is enforced in code, not by the model.

---

## Core Properties

- Explicit agent roles (writer, evaluator, optimizer, summarizer)
- Intent-aware generation constraints
- Style treated as presentation, not truth
- Frozen focus-factor optimization
- Regression guards and rollback
- Best-iteration guarantee
- Full iteration observability via LangSmith

## Agent Roles

### Generator Agent (Writer)

Responsibilities:
- Drafts the initial LinkedIn post
- Applies intent-specific rules
- Produces claim-driven content (not format-driven)

Proof of Work rules:
- Uses only user-provided facts and metrics
- No invented mechanisms, tools, or numbers
- Allows bounded interpretation
- No forced bullets or point counts

Tech Thought Leadership rules:
- Opinionated, production-grounded reasoning
- No metrics or numbers
- Structured explanations allowed

---

### Communication Style (Presentation Layer)

Style controls how content is written, not what is allowed.

- ENGINEERING_DIRECT — concise, factual
- VIRAL_ENGINEER — scroll-stopping, senior POV
- STORY_DRIVEN — narrative arc, still factual

Truth constraints always dominate style.

---

## Evaluator Agent (Editor)

Responsibilities:
- Scores drafts across fixed dimensions
- Produces structured feedback
- Never decides acceptance
- Runs deterministically (temperature = 0)

Scoring dimensions (0–10):
1. Hook strength
2. Factual grounding
3. Cause → effect clarity
4. Interpretive judgment
5. Information density

The evaluator never sees acceptance thresholds.
All stopping, rollback, and acceptance logic is enforced in code.

---

## Optimizer Agent (Line Editor)

Responsibilities:
- Refines drafts using evaluator feedback
- Improves clarity and density
- Removes redundancy and abstraction
- Preserves all factual constraints

Allowed:
- Merge or remove weak claims
- Reformat structure if clarity improves
- Strengthen interpretation without adding facts

Not allowed:
- Add new facts or metrics
- Reframe intent
- Trade one score for another

---

## Scoring, Optimization & Rollback Strategy

Focus factor selection:
- After first evaluation, the two lowest-scoring dimensions are frozen
- Only these dimensions may be optimized
- A focus factor is removed once it reaches ≥ 8

Early stop:
- If the initial draft scores ≥ 35, optimization is skipped

Regression guards:
- First optimization regression → stop
- Later focus regression → rollback and stop
- Focus flattened + non-focus regression → rollback and stop
- Fail-soft termination (e.g. evaluator or generator failure) is treated as a first-class stop condition and logged explicitly for post-run analysis.


Best iteration guarantee:
- Best iteration tracked after every evaluation
- Final output always uses best iteration
- Rollback restores best iteration before summarization

---

## Summarization Semantics

- Summarizes changes between initial and best iteration
- Excludes exploratory or rolled-back drafts
- Never re-evaluates or introduces new claims

---

## LangGraph Control Logic

LangGraph is used to:
- Make state explicit and typed
- Prevent infinite loops
- Enforce stop and rollback rules in code
- Separate decision logic from model behavior

---

## Observability & LangSmith Tracing

Each iteration logs:
- Per-dimension scores
- Focus-factor trajectories
- Score deltas
- Best-iteration deltas
- Rollback events
- Stop reasons
- Fail-soft termination reasons (e.g. LLM timeout, API failure) are recorded in Stop reasons

All traces are recorded in LangSmith for inspection.

## Model Configuration by Agent Role

### Generator (Writer)
- **Model:** gpt-4.1  
- **Temperature:** 0.6  
- **Purpose:** Draft realistic, senior-engineer content with strong POV and bounded interpretation.

### Evaluator (Editor)
- **Model:** gpt-4.1-mini  
- **Temperature:** 0.0  
- **Purpose:** Strict, deterministic scoring and critique; never decides acceptance.

### Optimizer (Line Editor)
- **Model:** gpt-4o-mini  
- **Temperature:** 0.2–0.3  
- **Purpose:** Constrained refinement of weak dimensions only; improves clarity and density without adding facts.

### Intent Classifier
- **Model:** gpt-4.1-mini  
- **Temperature:** 0.0  
- **Purpose:** Deterministically classify intent (Proof of Work vs Tech Thought Leadership) to enforce downstream constraints.

### Summarizer (Change Summary)
- **Model:** gpt-4.1-mini  
- **Temperature:** 0.0  
- **Purpose:** Explain changes between the initial draft and the best iteration; no re-evaluation or new claims.


Using separate models prevents self-agreeing loops and improves convergence.

## Summary

This repository shows how to build agentic systems that converge predictably, avoid over-optimization, and expose failure modes clearly by enforcing control logic in code rather than relying on prompt tweaks.
